This project create a simple REST server you can use to communicate with mcollective (rpc communication).

To compile/execute this script you need to install this packages on your machine:

rubygem-sinatra: the simple ruby webserver
rubygem-json: used to code the response

After this you can run the server, for development, with:

ruby mc-rpc-restserver.rb

and verify if all works well, testing this in your browser:

http://localhost:4567/mcollective/no-filter/rpcutil/ping/


NOTE:
Considering that inside the rest server (the file you are running) we are calling mcollective, is necessary that you install and execute this script on a machine where you have installed and configured mcollective (at least as a client).
