This project creates a simple REST server that you can use to communicate with
mcollective (rpc communication).

To execute this script you need to install these packages on your machine:

rubygem-sinatra : a light webserver in ruby
rubygem-json : used to format the response
rubygem-daemons : to daemonize the server 

After this you can run the server, for testing, with:

ruby mc-rpc-restserver-control.rb start

You can test the service with:

http://localhost:4567/mcollective/no-filter/rpcutil/ping/

NOTE:
Considering that inside the rest server we call mcollective, it is necessary
to install and launch this script on a machine on which mcollective (at least as
a client) is installed and configured.
