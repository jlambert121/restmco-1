This project creates a simple REST server that you can use to communicate with
mcollective (rpc communication).

To execute this script you'll need to install some packages on your machine :

rubygem-sinatra : a light webserver in ruby
rubygem-json : used to format the response
rubygem-daemons : to daemonize the server 

You'll find the packages on http://www.kermit.fr/repo/rpm/ 

Considering that inside the rest server we call mcollective, it is necessary
to install and launch it on a machine on which mcollective is installed and
configured (at least as a client).

See https://github.com/thinkfr/documentation 

Run the server, for testing, with :

ruby mc-rpc-restserver-control.rb start

Test the service on the URL :

http://localhost:4567/mcollective/no-filter/rpcutil/ping/

You can then deploy the application with Apache and Phusion Passenger
(or keep the mc-rpc-restserver-control.rb daemonizer).

It has been tested on el5 with ruby 1.8.6 with these packages :

mod_passenger-3.0.8-1.el5.x86_64.rpm
rubygem-passenger-3.0.8-1.el5.x86_64.rpm
rubygem-passenger-native-3.0.8-1.el5.x86_64.rpm
rubygem-passenger-native-libs-3.0.8-1.el5_1.8.6.399.x86_64.rpm

You'll find the packages on http://www.kermit.fr/repo/rpm/ 

Check the configuration example for Apache under misc/httpd.conf

Don't forget the configuration for selinux if it is set in enforcing mode.
For example, if you put the application in /var/www/restmco :
grep httpd /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M passenger
semodule -i passenger.pp
semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t "/var/www/restmco(/.*)?" 
restorecon -R /var/www/
ls -ldZ /var/www/restmco/*
